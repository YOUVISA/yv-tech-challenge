# YOUVISA Tech Code Challenge

The challenge consists in:
  - Building a frontend application
    - It's required that it uses React.js and Next.js
  - The application needs a route to render
    - Pricing plans by categories with sub-categories
      - Category -> Sub-Category -> Plans (Product with Plans)
    - Each Product shall contain at least one image
    - The page must be visibly good
      - Doesn't need to be an original idea, but if the page is copied, reference it
      and make some distinct changes to the page
  - Backend not required
